* it becomes visible to all the other users.
* users can also provide milestones, that they want to achieve within the idea.
* users who have added similiar tags to their interests get notified.
* users can give suggestions through discussion section
* users can also work on the idea, and can provide update as the development progresses.
* users can also save the ideas to review later on.
* users can filter feed on the basis of parameters like votes, relevance, time, etc.
